                <h2>Character Overview</h2>
                <div id="container">
                    <p>
                        Halvan is a member of the Freeblades and one of the double axe fighters that join you at the beginning of the game. He's a competent 
                        combat unit with a few of his own quirks. 
                        <br><br>
                        Like Orsin, Halvan's growth stats are mediocre, but his base stats are high enough for him to one-round KO most early-game enemies in Thracia 776. 
                        Although he has a little less SPD, Halvan's strong and fast enough to dominate many weak fighters. 
                        <br><br>
                        Despite not having a personal weapon, Halvan has a great PCC of 4 that helps out his combat potential, and he is given a Brave Axe if you visit 
                        one of the villages with him in Chapter 1. Although not exclusive to him, the Brave Axe can deal serious damage along with his Vantage skill, 
                        allowing him to draw first blood in most cases. 
                        <br><br>
                        Halvan may be the weaker axe fighter, but he does not fall too behind given his Vantage skill and high PCC. Consider using him unless his 
                        stats don't go anywhere or if you find better combat units.

                <p>
                    With a base HP of 28 and a base CON of 12, Halvan is a great candidate for early-game capturing. This is made much more easier with the Brave Axe, 
                    but more on that later. Halvan has a point higher than Orsin in terms of STR and CON, but is 2 points lower in terms of SPD. This means that 
                    Halvan may not double in some cases while capturing, although he has more capture potential and hits raw hits a little harder. His poor LCK 
                    makes him susceptible to low digit enemy criticals, so watch out for that. Despite having nearly identical stats to Orsin, Halvan may struggle 
                    to kill enemies with his lack of crit potential in the early-game. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Having an amazing growth rate in HP means a lot less when you look at Halvan's SKL, SPD, LCK, and DEF growths. Most of the growth rates are flat 
                    30's, which is a bit troublesome, as it is easy to get terrible level-ups unless you're really lucky. Overall, it all depends on luck that determines 
                    whether or not Halvan gains good growths throughout the early-game, as not too many Crusader scrolls are made accessible until later. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Halvan has a higher PCC and axe rank compared to Orsin, but these statistical advantages don't amount to much. Axe ranks are easy to train, and 
                    Halvan's PCC of 4, while being impressive, is difficult to make use of if he cannot use any weapon that grants a significant crit bonus. Killer 
                    Axes do exist in this game, but they are hard to obtain and very rarely equipped by enemy units. If you wish to make the most of Halvan, I highly
                    suggest finding an axe with a good crit bonus, as Halvan will be able to dominate with any axe of the like. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Vantage is a good skill to have as it limits the damage you take from counter-attacks if you bait the enemy into attacking first. It won't be super 
                    useful until you receive the Brave Axe, however. Other than that, Vantage doesn't grant much benefit unless you can kill the enemy in one hit, which 
                    is possible in this game given the variety of effective weapons. Halvan can make much use of these effective weapons, so be sure to stick them on 
                    Halvan. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    With no leadership/movement stars, Halvan doesn't offer much else. His promotion gives a significant boost to his combat stats, meaning you don't 
                    have to worry too much about getting his stats up. A D rank in swords isn't super useful as Thracia 776 gives you many outstanding sword units 
                    anyway.

                <h3>Character Tips</h3>

                <p>
                    Halvan's best early-game weapon is the Brave Axe. Combined with his Vantage skill, Halvan can deal two hits of significant damage, or kill 
                    the attacking enemy outright, if he is attacked while holding this axe. It's also great for capturing as Halvan has two points of base SPD less 
                    than Orsin. Definitely stick this great weapon on Halvan until you find a better candidate.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Like with Orsin, try to give Halvan a Crusader scroll or two to help out a stat that he's falling behind on. You'll want to distribute these 
                    scrolls equally to make the most of your team. 
                </p>
