                <div id="container">
                    <p>
                        Asbel is a powerful mage that is recruited by talking to him with Leif in Chapter 4x. He is a super useful asset in the early
                        game, an amazing bosskiller, and an overall great combat unit.  
                        <br><br>
                        Despite being quite fragile, Asbel is your first mage and has great access to the Wind magic tomes, which are the best in the 
                        entire game. Armed with his broken PRF Grafcalibur, Asbel is one of the most reliable ways to one-round bosses, and 
                        easily defeats most enemy units. 
                        <br><br>
                        Being the first mage you recruit, Asbel is also the first Sage you can obtain. Sage promotions in this game are insane, providing 
                        great boosts to MAG, SKL, and SPD, as well as a few useful weapon ranks. 
                        <br><br>
                        Asbel is a useful crutch in the early game, and he remains useful as you progress through the chapters due to his good growths,
                        absurd Sage promotion, and reliable access to powerful Wind tomes.

                <p>
                    Although Asbel is a crazy unit, his early game is quite troublesome. His base stats are generally unimpressive, and with 0 base STR, even 
                    beginner magic tomes like the Fire tome weighs down a couple of points in SPD. He won't be able to double right away, and his low HP and low DEF
                    makes him susceptible to being two-shot in the early game. Despite this, his SPD growth is great at 75%, so he'll be able to double with just a 
                    few levels, even with the tomes weighing him down. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sure, 0 STR and low growths for both STR and DEF is troublesome, but Asbel's SPD and decent MAG growth means he'll do big damage to most enemies, 
                    and he attacks at range anyway. As I mentioned in the overview, he is quite fragile, so be sure to take care of him, as you don't get to recruit
                    another magic user until a few chapters later. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Asbel has access to Fire, Thunder, and Wind tomes, not bad for an early game mage. I would suggest training Asbel's Wind rank as much as 
                    possible so that he can get to A rank and use the Blizzard tome, a powerful siege tome that puts the enemy to sleep on hit. I say this because Asbel, besides 
                    another late game recruit, is one of the only mages that can reliably use Wind magic, as even the basic Wind tome is not available to mages
                    with an E rank in Wind. Wind tomes are available in a few shops, and they're not particularly difficult to steal, but they're the best basic tome in the 
                    game, and perfect for leveling Asbel's Wind rank, so be sure to get your hands on a few of them. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here we can see the reason why Sage promotions are busted. Asbel gains impressive boosts to MAG/SKL/SPD, and even DEF, which he lacked before. 
                    The Sage promotion also grants him access to basic Light tomes and staves. Although it's difficult to get Asbel to a great staff level, you mustn't 
                    worry too much, as Thracia gives you many units that are solely useful for their good staff rank. However, Asbel's promotion still grants him access
                    to healing staves, which further improves his utility, in both staff usage and combat. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Asbel also has the Adept skill, which is nice, if even a little unnecessary due to his high crit Wind tomes/PRF and great PCC. He also has a movement 
                    star, which grants a 5% chance for an extra turn. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Grafcalibur is the ultimate boss killer. Since thrones/gates provide massive bonuses to DEF but not MAG, Asbel can wipe out most bosses in the game
                    with his PRF alone since he can ignore DEF. This weapon is incredibly light at 3 Weight, packs a 13 Might, and adds a whopping 40% crit. Since Asbel has a PCC of 3, every
                    follow-up with his PRF is a guaranteed critical. It may not provide any additional effects, but it has everything it needs to be a 
                    great boss killer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Keep in mind, it only has 40 uses, so be mindful when using it. In my opinion, it is definitely worth a Hammerne staff use, but I leave it 
                    to you on how to use this weapon.

                <h3>Character Tips</h3>

                <p>
                    Asbel can greatly benefit from a variety of tomes, pretty much any that grant growth rate boosts to STR and/or DEF. Don't worry too much 
                    about his MAG/SKL/SPD growths, as his growth rates are quite good for those stats, and his promotion will greatly help him anyway. As for his
                    STR and DEF, the Hoðr, Njörun, and Dain scrolls are excellent for patching up those weaknesses, although Asbel will perform just fine without them, as 
                    long as you keep him away from physically powerful enemy units. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you wish for Asbel to double much earlier than usual in the early game, then I would suggest giving Asbel the Ced scroll. It pushes his SPD growth 
                    rate past 100%, so he gets a guaranteed point in SPD at every level-up. The second Asbel can double, the easier the early game becomes. In the late 
                    game, Asbel's only weaknesses may be his low STR and DEF, but they can be mitigated a tiny bit by using the scrolls mentioned above. There aren't 
                    any particular skill manuals that Asbel can go crazy with, but if you have one leftover, such as Vantage, there's no harm in giving them to Asbel. 
                    There are other units that could many put them to better use, though. 
                </p>
