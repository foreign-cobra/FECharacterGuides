                    <p>
                        Ronan is the second archer you can recruit in the game by visiting the house right below the seize point in Chapter 2. As a unit, Ronan 
                        isn't too great, and he takes a lot of effort to be useful in combat. 
                        <br><br>
                        Being an archer, Ronan has a lot of the same problems as Tanya. He cannot counter in most enemy phase attacks, cannot capture, and while being 
                        able to attack at range, he is restricted in attacking.   
                        <br><br>
                        Although he's speedy enough to double most early-game units, and boasts an usually high 3 movement stars, Ronan's shaky growths and archer 
                        class hinders his potential a bit too much. 
                        <br><br>
                        Of course, any Thracia 776 unit can be good with scroll abuse, but Ronan especially struggles to excel in combat due to his garbage STR 
                        growth and limited weapon access.

                <p>
                    Some of Ronan's base stats are worse than Tanya, such as his SPD and MAG, but he does have a higher CON and STR, which automatically makes him a 
                    better unit. His SPD is enough to double the early-game bandits, anyway. His shaky SKL/SPD is also enough to lower his hit rate, though, so expect 
                    him to miss pretty frequently, at least in the early-game. Ronan's most troubling stat is his base STR and growth. His STR is alreayd quite 
                    bad as it is, but a 15% STR growth is further insult to injury. He instead has a 55% growth in MAG...? Which is strange, considering Ronan requires 
                    STR instead of MAG. He's an archer, not a mage! Anyway...
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ronan has base 7 movement, so he'll be able to move around the map much quicker than most of your foot units. He doesn't gain a movement point 
                    in his promotion, however. His CON is high enough to neglect some of his bows' weight, but don't expect that stat to level up naturally with that 
                    2% growth rate. Overall, most of Ronan's offensive growths are somewhat solid, except for his STR, of course. 
                </p>

                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <p>
                    An E rank in bows is expected, and although it might be difficult to level up, it can be done as long as Ronan is always seeing combat. Don't 
                    expect him to do any significant damage at first, though. An Adept skill is super useful, as this will allow Ronan to further build his weapon 
                    rank by occasionally attacking again. His PCC of 1 doesn't help much, though, which is why it is crucial that you train Ronan's weapon rank and 
                    his STR stat as much as you can, so that he'll be able to damage without needing to rely on PCC.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ronan's promotion gains are exactly like Tanya's, except he doesn't any extra movement because of his base 7 movement. The STR/SKL/SPD/DEF gains are 
                    helpful, but it's not enough to make Ronan great because he will most likely have bad stats if you leveled him up to promotion naturally. 
                    However, Ronan <i>does</i> have 3 movement stars... which means he'll have a 15% chance to just act again after he ends his turn. Ronan is quite 
                    the gambler, honestly. He might be a terrible unit one turn, but he might also proc Adpet, crit, and move twice in another.

                <h3>Character Tips</h3>

                <p>
                    Since the only significant STR boosting scroll is the Njörun scroll in Chapter 18, you'll have to rely on on the Hoðr, Baldr, and the Nál scrolls, 
                    obtained in Chapter 2x, 3, and 8x, in that order. He may also benefit from the Od scroll and the Ced scroll, since the boosts he gets from those 
                    scrolls bring his SKL/SPD growth to about 80%. The only stat let to fix is Ronan's DEF, in which has a terrible 5% growth. The Dain scroll is 
                    useful, but Ronan may not need it since he can attack from range and potentially avoid damage entirely. His MAG might grow like a weed if you're lucky, 
                    so if anything, Ronan might be more helpful in fending off the dark mages in the later maps. Pay attention to how Ronan's growths play out, and plan 
                    accordingly. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ronan's a strange character simply because of his baffling growths. Regardless, he's still a low-tier unit that requires a lot of effort to be good. 
                    Whether you decide to train him is up to you.  
                </p>
