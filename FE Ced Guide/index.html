                <h2>Character Overview</h2>
                <div id="container">
                    <p>
                        Ced is a late game recruit that joins your party in Chapter 23. He fits the "Samson and Arran" archetype in which you cannot recruit him
                        and Sais in a single playthrough. As soon as Ced joins your party, Sais cannot be recruited. If I had to choose between these two units,
                        I would definitely choose to recruit Ced over Sais. Here's a few reasons why. 
                        <br><br>
                        Ced's weapon ranks are amazing. He has an A rank in all magic types except for Thunder, as he has a B rank with Thunder. 
                        Ced also has an A rank in staves, which means he can use almost all advanced tomes and staves to his advantage. Status staves
                        are a huge help in the endgame, and recruiting Ced basically nets you a free A rank staff user. 
                        <br><br>
                        His PRF, Forseti, is quite possibly the best PRF in the entire game. It grants a +20 to both SKL and SPD, and has a tremendous 
                        Might of 20 with a flat 30 crit. It is near impossible to not be able to kill any enemy in the game with this tome unless you
                        somehow miss the 99 hit rate cap in Thracia, or if your enemy procs Pavise. 
                        <br><br>
                        There is no reason to <i>not</i> recruit Ced. He doubles as an amazing sage combat unit with his broken PRF and an extra A rank
                        staff user that can abuse status staves. Definitely consider using him.

                <p>
                    Ced's base stats are great and extremely solid all around. In fact, his SKL and SPD growths are 
                    irrelevant since his Forseti grants huge bonuses to those stats, and it will most likely last until the end of the game. 
                    Every combat stat besides STR and DEF are exceptional, and even then, Ced does not require too much Defense since he 
                    one-rounds almost every enemy, and with Forseti, he's almost untouchable. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The most impressive thing about Ced is quite possible his weapon ranks. He has an A rank in all magic types except Thunder. 
                    As such, Ced can use many advanced tombs, as well as powerful siege tombs like Blizzard and Meteor... perhaps even Bolting
                    if you decide to train his Thunder rank. Also, since Ced's base magic is relatively high, he will most likely be able to 
                    abuse status staves against many enemies. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ced has a very nice PCC of 3, which provides an incredibly high crit chance if he is using his Forseti. It is unlikely for 
                    Ced to <i>not</i> crit while he engages in combat. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    With 2 Movement Stars, Ced has a nice 10% chance to act again, and he also boasts a leadership star, which is uncommon with most of 
                    Thracia's cast. Even if you do not wish to train Ced in any way, deploying him is extremely useful simply for his leadership
                    star. Ced's other stats are impressive, and although he lacks promotion gains due to being a prepromote, he is still
                    an extremely useful unit for his staff and leadership utility. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Forseti is an instant win button. It packs a tremendous 20 Might and a hefty 30% crit. As I mentioned earlier, Ced can 
                    and will one-round almost every enemy in the game with this broken PRF. The huge bonus to SKL/SPD greatly increses his 
                    Avoid, so Ced will have no trouble dodge tanking multiple enemies. Don't be afraid of using Ced's Forseti. It has 50 
                    uses and will most likely last for the entire endgame unless you throw Ced into dozens of enemies. All in all, this 
                    PRF is an amazing boss-killer and an instant win button.

                <h3>Character Tips</h3>

                <p>
                    There aren't any game-breaking tips I could give you to maximize Ced's utility since he's already a really great unit. To 
                    use Ced at his maximum potential, simply have him use Forseti and a couple of status staves, then watch him decimate the 
                    enemy. The endgame chapters are made much easier with the use of status staves, so Ced is a welcome staff user if you
                    already have competent mages. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ced has 8 levels of growth left in him before he hits max-level, so I would suggest giving him the Dain scroll to boost 
                    his DEF a little so that he becomes a little more durable against physical damage. Other than that, he can cap 20 in MAG/SKL/SPD 
                    normally since his growth rates in those stats are so high. Ced is a great unit that requires no investment to be made useful.
                    If you do decide to recruit Ced instead of Sais, you won't be disappointed. 
                </p>
