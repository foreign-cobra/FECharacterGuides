                        Marty is one of the worst, if not <i>the</i> worst, unit in Fire Emblem History. He's a huge meme in the community 
                        due to his base stats being straight-up laughable, and the fact that he's a, interestingly enough, playable brigand/
                        mountain thief. He joins in Chapter 1 during Turn 3, but is recruited again in Chapter 8 by having Orsin or Halvan speak 
                        to him. 
                        <br><br>
                        Being a brigand, there was never any doubt that Marty was going to be a terrible unit. With his terrible base stats and 
                        even more terrible growths, it's obvious that Marty just isn't a great unit to begin with. However, he does excel in 
                        HP and CON growths, and has a somewhat decent DEF base stat and growth. 
                        <br><br>
                        Most players use Marty as a capture unit, a unit to keep captured enemy units and as fodder to soak up damage. Marty can excel
                        with appropriate scroll and arena abuse, but that is a lot of investment for a unit that's not worth it. 
                        <br><br>
                        Thracia 776 gives you many tools to take a unit like Marty from the ground up. Despite being a huge meme in the community, Marty can 
                        has a fighting chance of being decently useful with scroll/arena abuse, skill manuals, and weapons such as the Brave Axe.

                <p>
                    There it is in all of its glory. Marty's base stats! Yes, they're awful. A whopping 0 in MAG/SKL/SPD means that pitting 
                    him against a mage is a death sentence, and he'll struggle to hit literally anything. To add insult to injury, he is 
                    equipped with a Steel Axe, a super heavy weapon that would further harm his Attack Speed if his CON wasn't so high. 
                    Speaking of which, his CON is amazing! Although this makes Marty almost impossible to rescue, Marty's high CON lets 
                    him be able to capture lots of enemy units, and he's hardly weighed down by even the heaviest of weapons. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Marty has an immensely high HP and CON growth rate, at 90% and 75%. He'll gain HP and CON no problem, and even LCK, 
                    surprisingly. DEF may also increase a lot if you're lucky. However, every other stat is awful, with each one having less 
                    than a 20% chance of leveling up in any given level-up. Even Marty's base 9 STR is surprisingly low for a brigand, with a pitiful 
                    15% growth rate. That's... so bad. So... don't expect Marty to go anywhere with these stats if you're not
                    arena/scroll abusing. Marty has clear strengths and weaknesses. He is basically a damage sponge that has the 
                    ability to capture almost anything that moves, but is simply unable to because of his rotten SKL/SPD. At least... that's the 
                    case in the early game.

                <p>
                    Marty's other stats have nothing of interest besides his promotion gains. He has no leadership/movement stars, a 
                    very low 1 PCC, no skills whatsoever, and he begins with a low Axe rank of D. Wonderful. <i>But</i>! He does have 
                    a really good Warrior promotion, one that is almost as good as the Sage promotion. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    It offers a whopping +5 to SPD, a helpful +3 to STR and CON, +5 to SKL, and other helpful weapon ranks. Although this doesn't 
                    make Marty into a combat god, it increases his combat potential immensely. If you scroll abused him to get him to promotion, 
                    then he likely gained a few level-ups in the important stats, and this promotion will only help him further. However, 
                    even if Marty's stats end up getting close to capping, he'll still struggle due to a low PCC and lack of skills.

                <h3>Character Tips</h3>

                <p>
                    Marty can work surprisingly well in the Manster Escape Sequence. If you plan to use Marty long term and don't want to wait 
                    to abuse him in the arena, then give him the Speed Ring and the Ced scroll you get from Ced in Chapter 4x. The Odo scroll 
                    is also made available very early in the game, at Chapter 6. With these two, Marty <i>could</i> earn some valuable level-ups 
                    in SKL/SPD. Leveling his MAG won't be too big of a deal since Marty can get so much HP due to his 90% growth that he'll
                    most likely soak up magic damage better than any sage ever could. The only real problem now is his horrendous STR, and 
                    only the Njörun scroll offers a significant boost in STR at 30%, but this scroll is obtainable only until you reach Chapter 18, 
                    really late in the game. Until then, pair the Hoðr and Nál scrolls on Marty, as they both will offer a 20% increase to 
                    STR. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As for skill manuals, there aren't any notable ones that could drastically improve Marty's performance. The Paragon manual 
                    could be used on Marty if you're really struggling with netting him some EXP, and there are others such as Wrath that 
                    improve his enemy phase potential, and Sol that increase his survivability. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Even with all of this scroll abuse, Marty could still fall short of important stat level-ups, and he may still fall short of 
                    other units because of his low PCC and lack of skills. Regardless, Marty is meant to be a weak character, a meme of the community, 
                    so if you followed this guide and made Marty a reliable combat unit, then I applaud you, good sir!
