                        Sarah may be considered an "Est", given that she joins pretty late in the game, and has some mediocre stats. Despite this, Sarah is 
                        most definitely worth using as every other aspect of her utility makes her extremely useful. She can be recruited in Chapter 16 on the 
                        B route and Chapter 17 on the A route. 
                        <br><br>
                        With bonker growth rates, S tier skills, a Sage promotion, and a B rank in staves, there is almost nothing Sarah <i>cannot</i> become
                        good at as long as you throw some EXP at her. She doesn't even require all that much investment given that she has the "Paragon" skill,
                        so the problem of gaining EXP fast enough is non-existent when using Sarah. 
                        <br><br>
                        She may have a super low PCC, but her Wrath skill makes her an enemy phase monster, especially since she hits with magic. Her Sage promotion
                        turns her into an amazing unit outright, and it also adds a few weapon ranks to help her out. Sarah's only weaknesses may be her fragility 
                        and lack of access, since she joins much later than other characters. 
                        <br><br>
                        Sarah does not need to be properly trained to be a good unit. She has all of the skills and utility necessary to be a reliable Sage and 
                        A rank staff user!

                <p>
                    Sarah's base stats aren't anything special. Her base 0 STR kills her usefulness in combat as she constantly gets weighed down by even
                    the lightest of tomes. Her SPD goes down as a result, so she is not useful as a combat unit right off the bat. Another notably terrible 
                    stat is her HP. I believe she has the lowest base HP out of every other character in the entire game, and this is a huge weakness for her. 
                    A low HP means that even chip damage can kill her with just a few hits, and she gets fatigued <i>very</i> easily through staff usage, and
                    you're going to want to get her to A rank staves as soon as possible. Her HP is a massive letdown, but don't let that distract you 
                    from her growth rates!
                </p>

                <p>
                    An 80% growth rate in MAG/SKL/SPD? That's insane! Sarah does not need any scrolls for these three stats, and good thing too, since MAG/SPD 
                    are two of the most important stats that make or break a mage unit. Although Sarah does have a pitiful 0% growth in STR and a 10% growth 
                    in DEF... they aren't the stats that are important to her utility. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Feel free to level Sarah to 10 as fast as possible so you can promote her. You probably already know how broken Sage promotions are, but in
                    Sarah's case, it's even more impressive. The MAG/SKL/SPD growths are overkill given her growth rates, and the other bonuses, such as the 
                    extra 3 points to DEF, extra 2 points to MOV, and a +1 to <b>all</b> MAG types and staves? Yes, please! This Sage promotion doesn't help Sarah's 
                    weapon ranks too much, but it automatically makes her an A rank staff user, and lets her use a variety of tomes. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sarah can grow even more with her Paragon skill. Getting to level 10 is a piece of cake if you just give her a chance to use some staves. 
                    Even after promotion she will level up very quickly and cap all of the necessary stats. Her Wrath skill gives her some great combat potential,
                    but I would advise to keep her away from combat if you decide not to fix up her HP. Her Miracle skill can be useful, but since Sarah's growth in 
                    LCK is a basic 40%, and she doesn't get any promotion gains in this stat, it's situational at best. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Those 5 Movement Stars are also insanely impressive. With these, she has a flat 25% chance to move again under any circumstances. This is such a powerful
                    tool as a staff user, and a bit less so as a combat unit. Nevertheless, an extra turn is something that makes Sarah even more useful. 
                    Most players use Sarah as another A rank staff user, but she can easily transition into a combat unit if you decide to fix her low HP. Abuse her utility wisely!
                </p>

                   Only Sarah can use this Kia Staff, and it is used to cure the "Stone" status effect. To avoid spoilers, I'll only say that this staff
                   can cure one specific character in a gaiden chapter, and only the final boss of this game has a "Stone" weapon, with 5 uses. This means,
                   without the Hammerne staff, you will be unable to save both the gaiden character and at least one of your party members, should you deplete
                   the "Stone" weapon that the final boss has in the final chapter. Use the staff wisely, you may not have enough uses to cure all of the "Stone"
                   status effects that you may encounter.

                <h3>Character Tips</h3>

                <p>
                    A decent tip when using Sarah is to simply keep her away from enemy units that deal any kind of physical damage. Sarah does not have the 
                    resources to tank that many hits, even magical damage, due to her low base HP and low DEF growth rate. Plus, the more combat she endures,
                    the less she can use valuable staves before becoming fatigued. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The best way to fix this glaring issue is to give Sarah the appropriate scrolls. The Hoðr and Nál scroll give significant boosts to her HP gain,
                    and with her base 40% growth, the Hoðr scroll, with its 30% boost, can easily fix her HP stat. If you decide to do this, make sure to 
                    hold off on promoting Sarah if you really want her HP to get anywhere. This is probably the only glaring issue Sarah has, so make sure to 
                    wisely manage her HP. You don't want this unit to be fatigued if you really need her in a certain chapter. 
                </p>
