                    <p>
                        Galzus is a powerful unit that is recruited in Chapter 24 by having Mareeta talk to him. Although he's an extremely late recruit, 
                        he is immensely helpful in the last 2 or so chapters. 
                        <br><br>
                        Galzus has the Luna and Astra skills by default, and with absurdly high stats, 3 of them being capped, including STR, he decimates 
                        any enemy that dares to challenge him. He doesn't even require any investment since he is level-capped, so he's an instant win button. 
                        <br><br>
                        With high weapon ranks, broken skills, and absurdly high stats, Galzus is a free, broken unit that should be used if you get the chance.
                        He may have made your gameplay experience a living hell in the early game, but recruiting Galzus can save yourself much headache, especially
                        in the awful chapter that is 24x.

                <p>
                    Galzus' base stats are impressive. With STR/SKL/SPD capped, he is extremely capable in combat. A 9 in his MAG stat is also nice, as he won't be
                    completely vulnerable to magical attacks. A high base HP of 54 also helps with tanking hits. An 18 CON means he can capture most enemies, 
                    and a 14 in DEF makes him very durable. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    His growth rates are irrelevant, as Galzus is already capped when you recruit him. His base stats are what you get for the rest of the game, 
                    but there's nothing to complain about! Galzus is a monster in combat.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With an A rank in both Swords and Axes, Galzus can wield all kinds of those weapons with ease. I highly recommend giving
                    Galzus at least one master weapon, as he will most likely be able to strike four times with his 20 SPD. Not only that,
                    but his two skills, Luna and Astra, have a large chance of activating in almost every round of combat, if he is wielding
                    a master weapon. If you've seen my Mareeta character guide, then you'll already know how absurd these skills are. They 
                    work hand-in-hand in screwing over every possible enemy in the game.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Galzus also has a whopping 5 movement stars! Once he decimates an enemy, he has a 25% percent chance to just do it
                    again! Galzus truly is just an amazing unit as soon as you recruit him, similar to Pent in FE 7. He's just a super reliable
                    unit, and you have no reason to <i>not</i> use him.

                <h3>Character Tips</h3>

                <p>
                    I can't really give any amazing, game-breaking tips about how to use Galzus at his full potential, because he is already
                    game-breaking! However, there are some general tips you might want to keep in mind. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Galzus' only real weakness is against the dark mages in the endgame. He can safely one-round them with master weapons,
                    but this is Thracia, so make sure he doesn't get hit with a Hel tome or any other pesky dark magic. Furthermore, 
                    I would suggest giving Galzus a skill manual if you have one left over. With Sol, Galzus has a bit more survivability,
                    but with Vantage, he can wipe out any enemy with his other skills, Luna and Astra, and a master weapon, by striking first in every battle 
                    as long as he can counter-attack. Galzus is crazy with Vantage, but I understand if you have no skill manuals left. 
                    And perhaps give him your least used Crusader scroll so that he doesn't get crit, and since he won't gain any level-ups
                    either way. 
                </p>
