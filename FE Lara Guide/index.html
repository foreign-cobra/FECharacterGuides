                        Lara is the second thief that is recruited at the beginning of Chapter 4 automatically. Her utility seems a bit limited at first, but a 
                        special promotion down the line makes Lara an invaluable unit should you decide to use her. 
                        <br><br>
                        Despite having terrible base stats and being made of literal glass, Lara is a big help in the Manster Escape chapters, as her thieving 
                        capabilities allow her to open chests and pick locks. Although she is terrible for stealing weapons, she is useful simply because she's 
                        a thief. 
                        <br><br>
                        Combat-wise, Lara is next to useless. Even after promotion, Lara simply will not have the stats to be combat viable unless you really 
                        abuse the Crusader scrolls. 
                        <br><br>
                        Lara's usefulness comes when she promotes to the Dancer class in Chapter 12x. She can do so by speaking to Perne in that chapter. Since 
                        she's the only dancer in this game, her existence is greatly justified.

                <p>
                    Lara's base stats are comparable with Marty's. That is, her stats are complete garbage. With only 14 HP and a base 0 in both STR and DEF, Lara 
                    is built like a wet noodle that hits about as hard as a pillow. Her surprisingly low base 1 SKL kills her accuracy, which further proves that 
                    Lara is simply not fit for combat. She does have a good 10 base SPD and an impressive 7 MOV, but that only justifies using Lara to pick any 
                    kind of lock on the map. A base 3 CON is also really terrible, especially for a thief, as Lara will not be able to steal anything that isn't weightless. 
                    The most she can steal are vulneraries and some non-equippable items like Crusader scrolls. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The growth rates displayed here aren't much better. She has a great SKL/SPD/LCK growth, but that is simply not enough to boost her combat potential. 
                    Her 20% DEF growth will be a hassle to level-up, especially since the Dain scroll isn't available until Chapter 14. Her 5% CON growth rate will 
                    ensure that she will hardly be able to steal anything other than weightless items. She at least has a 45% HP growth, and with the amount of levels 
                    that Lara could potential go through, it's very possible to get Lara to an absurdly high HP. More on that later. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    With an E rank in swords, no combat skills, and a PCC of 1, it should be obvious by now that sending Lara into combat is <i>not</i> a good 
                    idea. Also, while Lara does not have a leadership star, she has a movement star, so she'll move again in a single turn if you get lucky. 
                    The Steal skill, as explained earlier, is invaluable to your team in the Manster Escape chapters, and others as well if you don't have any 
                    other thief besides Lara. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Below is an overview of the many possible routes Lara can take for promotion. Lara can promote twice in this game. Her first promotion can be 
                    into a Rogue or a Dancer, and the second promotion can be from a Rogue to a Dancer, or from a Dancer to a Rogue. It's a bit confusing, but generally
                    players will want to keep Lara as either a Rogue or a Dancer depending on the circumstances.

                <p>
                    It's best to keep Lara as a Dancer if you choose to have her speak to Perne in Chapter 12x. Don't let the promotion gains, or rather, promotion
                    losses, discourage you. Lara has no use for combat stats anyway. When Lara is a Dancer, she retains her Steal skill and her ability to use lockpicks, 
                    so she'll retain all of her usefulness from before and be able to dance for other units, granting them a second turn. This is a great unit to have 
                    on your team, as Lara can grant an extra action to your most powerful units and increase the flexibility of your strategies. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    You <i>can</i> turn Lara into a Rogue after she's been promoted to a Dancer, but there's very little reason to do that. Lara is the weakest Rogue 
                    you can get on your team out of the three thieves/rogues you get throughout the game (with Perne being the strongest). As mentioned earlier, 
                    Lara's stats won't go anywhere without heavy scroll abuse, so it's usually best to keep Lara as a Dancer for her utility.
                </p>

                <h3>Character Tips</h3>

                <p>
                    Lara is very vulnerable as a Dancer, so keep her a safe distance away from any and all enemies, especially sneaky ballistae. Keep in mind that 
                    Lara gains fatigue after performing a dancing action, and she will get fatigued easily since she has a low base HP. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    There's not many other tips I can give you other than to simply wait until you can promote Lara into a Dancer. Increasing Lara's stats isn't worth it, 
                    as she's way more useful as a Dancer. If you wish to cap her stats, then just stick every possible scroll on her and feed her some kills. 
                    Try it if you dare! 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I mentioned earlier that Lara is one of the few characters that can reach an absurdly high HP because of her ability to promote twice. 
                    If you want Lara to have a massive amount of HP for whatever reason, then stick the Hoðr, Baldr, Nál, and the Thrud scroll on her and feed her 
                    kills. You won't have all of these scrolls at once, but give them to Lara as you obtain them. Make sure she has decent enough stats before you 
                    start to abuse the arena. Make sure Lara is capped before Chapter 12x. Promote her to Dancer and spam Dance until she is capped at Level 20 
                    again (don't forget to give her the HP boosting scrolls, and don't forget that Lara gains fatigued by dancing). When Lara is capped, 
                    give her another Master Seal and grind the arena until she's capped. And there you have it, Lara will have a super high amount of HP, and probably
                    some decent stats since you grinded her about 50+ levels, plus a promotion. Have fun! (I don't know why anyone would want to do this).
