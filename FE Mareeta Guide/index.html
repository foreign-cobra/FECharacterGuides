                        Mareeta is one of the most powerful units in Thracia 776, and for good reason. Assuming you didn't kill her in Chapter 5,
                        Mareeta returns in Chapter 12 at the opposite end of the map, in a lone house after a special cutscene plays. 
                        <br><br>
                        The reason why this unit is so broken is because of their insane growths, absurdly high PCC, super offensive skills, and access
                        to one of the best PRF's in the game. These aspects of her utility combined make her a force to be reckoned with, and in most cases,
                        she can break the game in half by making the most difficult bosses in the game a trivial matter. 
                        <br><br>
                        She isn't without weaknesses, however. Mareeta's base stats are terrible, and she requires some investment to reach her 
                        high potential. Her defensive stats are also bad, making her a sort of glass canon that you must handle with care. 
                        <br><br>
                        Mareeta's strengths heavily outweigh her weaknesses, however. After a few level-ups, she can quickly become one of your best offensive
                        units.

                <p>
                    Mareeta's base stats are terrible, no doubt, and she might not even be a necessary addition to your team if you have already promoted
                    a few units into combat gods. Even so, she grows like a weed when fed a few kills. Axe brigands are still very common at this point
                    in the game, so there should be no trouble letting Mareeta cut a few down to get a few levels.    
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mareeta might be one of your first characters to start capping stats, even though she begins with such low stats. Her Strength stat
                    is a whopping 60%, and similarly, her SKL/SPD/LCk growth rates are also insanely high. Every combat stat besides Mag and Def
                    will grow significantly within just a few levels. Honestly, what's not to like? 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Being a sword user, Mareeta has access to plenty of weaponry that is effective against most types of enemies. Her weapon rank
                    begins at D, which is quite bad, but she attacks quite often due to her PRF having a brave effect and possessing the Astra skill.
                    Not only that, but her promotion gives her +2 in her sword rank! Leveling her weapon rank will be no trouble at all if you do plan
                    on using her.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mareeta's promotion gives her a nice boost to STR/SKL/SPD, although it might be unnecessary due to her growth rates. Her promotion
                    is most useful for the weapon ranks she gains, and for the DEF/MOV points that she earns. Upon promotion, she also gains the Adept skill!
                    This gives Mareeta yet another chance to proc extra moves against any opponent she faces, and an extra chance for her to proc her 
                    broken skills. More below...
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mareeta can gain 4 skills naturally. She has Luna by default, which has a skill percentage chance to ignore defense. Her PRF
                    grants Nihil, which cancels enemy skills. She can be taught Astra by Shannam in Chapter 15, which has a skill percentage chance
                    to attack 5 times. She gains Adept from promotion, which has an attack speed percentage chance to attack once more. All of these 
                    combined make Mareeta a killing machine. She can decimate enemies even without being able to do a single point of damage against them,
                    thanks to her Luna skill. Nihil ensures that she can get past the annoying Pavise wielding bosses later in the game. 
                    Having a PCC of 5, Mareeta only needs a 20% crit cance for all of her consecutive attacks to be guaranteed criticals. Mareeta is insane,
                    enough said.

                    Mareeta's Sword is available as soon as Mareeta is recruited, since it is in her inventory. This PRF, despite having a mediocre
                    Might, has low Weight and a flat 20% Crit. As I mentioned earlier, Mareeta only needs a flat 20% crit chance to get a guaranteed
                    critical on <i>every</i> consecutive attack... Not only that, but this weapon grants the brave effect, and with Mareeta's high speed,
                    she is certain to quadruple attack almost every enemy type. Even <i>this</i> is uncommon, as Mareeta will most likely proc at least
                    one of her combat skills due to her high skill growth. The only problem with this PRF is that its uses are spent quickly since Mareeta
                    attacks a lot in a single round... be smart with its uses.

                <h3>Character Tips</h3>

                <p>
                    As I've mentioned before, Mareeta is quite the glass cannon. She can dish out attacks and criticals like nobody's business, but can she take
                    damage? No, she's no damage sponge. Her defense growth is quite poor, and being an infantry unit, she's susceptible to magical attacks as well. 
                    The best way to remedy this is to have Mareeta hog the Dain scroll, which boosts its user's Defense growth rate by a whopping 30%, but 
                    subtracts its user's Speed growth by 10%. This is obtained in Chapter 14, in Dean's inventory. This scroll is perfect for Mareeta, as she 
                    desperately needs the extra 30% Defense growth, and by the time you reach Chapter 14, Mareeta will already have leveled up her Speed quite
                    nicely. I recommend this strategy only if you wish to make Mareeta break the game. Mareeta can reach close to 20 Defense with this scroll and a 
                    bit of luck, but if you don't want her to hog it, no worries, as she can do just fine without it. Mareeta is strong enough even without broken Defense!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mareeta is also one of the best users of the Paragon manual, due to her low bases and level. Giving Mareeta this manual while having her 
                    equip Defense boosting scrolls during her level-ups would make her unstoppable. At times, it might make the game <i>too</i> easy, but then
                    again, Thracia 776 gives you all kinds of tools to counter the bullsh*t it throws at you. If you wish to use Mareeta and unlock her full 
                    potential, then give her scrolls that help her poorer stats, and give her the Paragon manual if you want her to reach her stat caps much 
                    quicker. 
                </p>
