                <h2>Character Overview</h2>
                <div id="container">
                    <p>
                        Sleuf is a priest that is an exclusive character available only in the A route. He is recruitable by having Leif visit the eastern village in Chapter
                        16A, if Leif visited the church in the previous chapter. 
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, Sleuf is just a great unit. He is excellent for one thing and one thing only, and that is his A staff rank. That's it. This alone
                        makes Sleuf a more valuable character than any of the exclusive characters in the B route. 
                        <br><br>
                        That's not all though. Sleuf, like any other staff/magic unit, can potentially cap a few stats with his decent growths in MAG, SKL, and SPD. 
                        He also has 3 movement stars, which is a huge plus. 
                        <br><br>
                        Sleuf is a very simple character. He's not that useful for combat, but given how broken status staves are in this game, and Sleuf's potential to cap 
                        MAG, he has everything he needs to be a worthy addition to your team.

                <p>
                    Sleuf's base stats are perfectly fine for a staff user. He has enough MAG to heal quite a bit with heal staffs, and his 12 SKL means that he 
                    will never miss with a staff, since it is higher than 10. Compared to your other staff-locked unpromoted users, Safy and Tina, Sleuf
                    has a bit more durability in comparison, and better SKL overall. Other than that, he is more or less the same as your other staff users. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The most impressive growth rate Sleuth has is his 75% SKL growth. Although, he doesn't really need this since he has already capped hit on his
                    staves. His MAG and SPD growths aren't super high, but they're good enough for Sleuf to get some nice boosts as he levels, and as he promotes. 
                    Sleuf's main goal is to be a staff bot, so most of his combat stats are a bit irrelvant, as rude as that is to say. Sleuf's stats just don't 
                    matter all that much since he probably won't see a single round of combat in the game. 
                </p>

                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <p>
                    Sleuf doesn't really have all that much going for him in his other stats. His promotion is pretty "meh" as he only gets a +1 in most of his stats
                    besides MAG. He has no PCC, which completely kills his combat potential, and he has no leadership stars. Despite this, Sleuf has everything he needs
                    to still be useful. His promotion gives him a +3 in MAG, which brings him much closer to the 20 cap, and with 3 movement stars, Sleuf has a 
                    15% chance to move again, which is pretty nice. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The High Priest promotion <i>does</i> grant Sleuf an E rank in Light magic... but it's a little useless. I highly recommend that you don't use 
                    Sleuf for combat, since it is a huge pain to train his super low Light magic rank, and with a PCC of 0, Sleuf will have a hard time killing 
                    anything with his mediocre SPD, STR, and inability to land criticals. Trust me when I say that Sleuf's A rank in staffs, 3 movement stars, and +3
                    in MAG after promotion is all he needs to be super useful.

                <h3>Character Tips</h3>

                <p>
                    If you get MAG screwed, Sleuf might require some assistance. I highly recommend giving him the Heim scroll if you notice that he's falling 
                    short of MAG level-ups. A MAG-capped Sleuf will be a huge help in the endgame chapters, as he can dispatch many annoying enemies from any
                    point in the map, and he needs a higher MAG to incapacite them. Another scroll I recommend is the Ho√∞r scroll, as it gives him a +30%
                    boost to HP, and Sleuf needs a good HP boost so that he doesn't become fatigued too easily. His base HP of 18 is a bit troubling. 
                     
                     
                </p>

                <p>
                    Other useful scrolls may be the Ced, Nal, or even the Blagi scroll that he has in his inventory when you recruit him. Try to increase Sleuf's 
                    HP and MAG the most, as those are the most crucial stats for Sleuf in the endgame. 
                </p>
