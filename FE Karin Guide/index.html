                    <p>
                        Karin is the first pegasus rider you recruit in this game, and is the only one you'll have at your disposal until Chapter 14. 
                        Because of this reason alone, she is invaluable when she joins! 
                        <br><br>
                        Unfortunately, since she is recruited during the Manster Escape Sequence, her usefulness is limited. Karin's defense isn't 
                        too great, and her low HP makes her quite vulnerable when she isn't mounted. She does strike quick, though.  
                        <br><br>
                        Karin's strengths lie in her flight ability, magic resistance, speed, and luck. Her remarkable speed and luck growth makes her 
                        a fast warrior, but her strength might be a problem as she levels. However, her flight, capture, and rescue capabilities outweigh
                        these weaknesses. 
                        <br><br>
                        In the beginning though, Karin does not have access to these strengths. During the Manster Escape Sequence, Karin is another
                        swordfighter added to your arsenal that performs about as well as Matcha with swords. This may seem like a hindrance, but 
                        training Karin in sword may prove useful later, as there are many Magic Swords she could make use of. Later, you can decide 
                        for yourself if training Karin in swords is worth it when you see her MAG growth for yourself!

                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <p>
                    Karin's base stats differ depending on whether she's mounted or dismounted (the values provided after the 
                    &rarr; symbol are for when she's mounted). Clearly, Karin might be overshadowed by other sword units you may have recruited,
                    such as Fergus and Matcha, but training her might be worthwhile if you look at her SPD and LCK growth. If she consistently 
                    sees battle during the chapters you first recruit her in, then it is not unlikely for her to nearly max out those stats. The same 
                    can't be said her STR and DEF though, so be mindful of Karin around particularly strong enemies during the escape sequence. 
                    Her MAG stat makes her a decent bait for magic users, though. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Feel free to disregard Karin's low CON, as her mounted form can rescue/carry every unit. You shouldn't disregard her STR, however.
                    It is one of her greatest weaknesses. That, along with her somewhat low DEF, carries over when she mounts. She still remains 
                    quite strong however, with her 8 MOV and incredible SPD. That 15% growth for both STR and DEF does not help matters either. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Karin's other stats... are very unimpressive. With no skills, 0 leadership stars, 0 movement stars, and 
                    decent promotion gains, you might expect Karin to perform very poorly as the game progresses. This is not necessarily
                    true, as Karin's great mobility and speed carries her for the most part. However, this limits how broken you can make her,
                    as she has to rely on solely her stats and whatever bonus you decide to give her (skill manuals, stat rings, etc.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    For this reason, it is essential that you patch up Karin's weaker stats if you plan to use her long-term. Below, I detail with 
                    Crusader Scrolls are most useful if you plan on using Karin. However, at the end of the day, Karin must rely on max stats 
                    in order to be useful (besides being a flying unit). Keep in mind that Karin is forced to be dismounted during the last few 
                    chapters of the game, where her usefulness will quickly fade away... PLEASE keep this in mind. 
                </p>

                <h3>Character Tips</h3>

                <p>
                    If you wish to improve Karin's combat utility, there may be a few combat manuals that you can slap on her to increase 
                    the damage she deals. The Wrath, Luna, and Adept manuals come to mind... and although other units can make these work 
                    much better, Karin may use these skills once in a blue moon. Wrath is great for countering, but considering Karin's 
                    fragility, things could could go wrong. Luna's activation rate depends on skill, and Adept depends on Attack Speed. Karin
                    might make things work, but as I said earlier, other units with better DEF and SKL potential can make use of these manuals.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Njörun and Dain Crusader Scrolls are all the scrolls you'll really need to patch up Karin's weaknesses, but there are 
                    many other units that could make use of these scrolls as well. Karin's HP is also a concern, so Hoðr and Nál scrolls should 
                    get her up to speed. As always, be sure to switch around scrolls and make sure your favorite units have one when leveling 
                    up. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As I mentioned earlier, Karin is very reliant on her stats, so if you wish to use her, switching around Crusader scrolls with 
                    her is extremely useful. If you wish to push the limits of her utility, giving her the leg ring can be very advantageous, 
                    especially since many chapters require you to travel far to reach houses with special items.     
                </p>
