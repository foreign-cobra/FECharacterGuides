                <div id="container">
                    <p>
                        Safy is your first staff bot, first recruited in Chapter 3, and later recruited in Chapter 7 after the Manster Escape Sequence.
                        Safy is a great introduction to staff usage in Thracia 776 and how absurdly broken they are. Although Safy is pretty basic as a 
                        staff user, even with a PRF, she is still valuable, and it's quite easy to get her to A rank Staves quickly. 
                        <br><br>
                        Her combat potential is practically non-existent, though. Safy gains the ability to use Light tomes upon promotion, but an E rank
                        makes it exceptionally difficult for her to get anywhere. Not to mention her defensive stats are really poor. So, it's best to 
                        limit her utility to staff usage. 
                        <br><br>
                        Safy joins with a high enough Staff rank to easily heal your wounded units with Heal and Physic, use Torch staves, Restore, and a 
                        variety of other powerful staves to make sure you always have the upper hand in player phase. As mentioned earlier, Safy also has a 
                        PRF that allows her to fix near broken weapons so that you'll always have access to either powerful staves or powerful weapons. 
                        <br><br>
                        Safy is the bread and butter for a good staff user. Her combat potential and defensive stats are big weaknesses, but she's never needed
                        for combat, and chances are, she might not even require a promotion.

                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <p>
                    Like any early game staff user, Safy's stats are overall pretty bad. A Base 0 DEF, 6 SPD, and 6 MAG would be a bad omen
                    for any other unit, but Safy doesn't need great stats to be useful. Only HP, MAG, and SKL are useful to Safy, as she needs 
                    high HP to not be fatigued as often, MAG so that she can use status staves against endgame enemies, and SKL so that she 
                    can reliably hit her staff uses. Remember, Safy will never enter combat, and if she does, she's pretty much a goner. 
                    Since combat stats are irrelevant, we can look at Safy's decent 6 MAG/SKL, and low base 14 HP. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Safy's growth rates are pretty decent if you ignore her DEF/CON/MOV. She's blessed with an unusually high STR growth rate at 
                    30%, and her HP/MAG/SKL growth rates are also pretty commendable. She won't be a stats monster, not without significant investment,
                    but Safy is good enough as long as you get her to that 10 SKL benchmark, so that she doesn't miss, and use her frequently to level 
                    up her staff rank. 
                </p>

                            <td><img src="FE5_Staff_Icon.webp">Staff - C</td>
                            <td>No Skills</td>

                            <td> MAG + 3 / SKL/SPD/DEF/MOV + 1 / Staff Rank + 1 / Light Rank E</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <p>
                    Safy only needs a couple staff uses to get to B rank Staves. Once she achieves that, she can promote to instantly attain
                    A rank staves, as her High Priest promotion grants an extra Staff rank. Safy starts to really shine once she achieves 
                    A rank staves and a high enough MAG. If you can get your hands on a few rare status staves in the early-mid game, then Safy can easily 
                    make your life much easier. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Her promotion is pretty lackluster, though. She gets a +1 to the stats mentioned above, but it's not enough to 
                    fix her horrid combat stats. To add insult to injury, Safy only gains the ability to use Light tomes upon promotion, 
                    and even then, it's only at E rank. This is the game's way of telling you that you should not try to invest in a combat 
                    Safy. There's just really no point to it. A total lack of skills doesn't help her case. Oh, also, she only has a 
                    PCC of 1. Yeah. Just don't make Safy engage in combat. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Besides her lackluster promotion, Safy's other stats are also pretty unremarkable. No movement or leadership stars, and a 
                    dreadful PCC of 1. Don't take this the wrong way, Safy is still a solid unit, but it's clear where her usefulness 
                    lies. 
                </p>

                <p>
                   Hammerne, or the "Repair" staff, is an awesome item that refills the durability of any weapon/staff. I highly advise that 
                   you do not hoard this staff, since there's no reason <i>not</i> to use it, but be mindful about its uses. You're going 
                   to want to use this staff on other PRF's, status staves, master weapons, brave weapons, and the like. Things like Warp, 
                   the Light Brand, Mareeta's Sword, Earth Sword, Silence, Sleep, etc. If you find yourself using a certain weapon/staff a 
                   bit too much, and it's about to run out of uses, consider a Hammerne use. Safy's existence makes your gameplay a lot less 
                   frustrating.

                <h3>Character Tips</h3>

                <p>
                    The stats you should focus on Safy are the ones that will increase her usefulness. First, her HP. A higher HP means 
                    she can perform more actions without being fatigued, although this is not necessary if you choose not to bring her to 
                    endgame. Regardless, the Hoðr and Nál scrolls are your best bet when trying to increase her HP. As for Safy's SKL, 
                    her most important stat when you recruit her, my advice is to give her the Odo and never take it off until she has 
                    hit 10 SKL. It offers the most significant boost to SKL, and it is not much use to anyone else, so make sure that this 
                    scroll is reserved for all of your staff users, including Safy. Safy's MAG has a good chance of capping naturally after leveling and promoting. If this is not the case for you because of RNG screwing, the Heim 
                    scroll can easily help her cap the MAG stat, guaranteed.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the battlefield, keep Safy out of all combat, that goes without saying. Her Staff rank and PRF is more than enough 
                    to be a godsend to your team in many chapters of the game. Whether you need to Warp a unit to skip a chapter, Rescue one 
                    out of a sticky situation, Restore a status, or Physic someone from far away, Safy's your girl. Her existence is meant 
                    to make your life easier.  
                </p>
