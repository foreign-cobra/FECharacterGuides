                    <p>
                        Linoan is a mage of the Sister class that joins at the beginning of Chapter 14x, or Chapter 15 if you skipped the gaiden. She's a good 
                        mage combat unit and potentially another A rank staff user if you choose to invest in her. 
                        <br><br>
                        She may not have any notable skills, but her Light and Staff ranks are impressive, as Linoan can use many helpful staves such as 
                        Ensorcel, Restore, and Physic right off the bat. Her high Light rank also allows her to use the Nosferatu tome, a powerful light 
                        tome that greatly improves her survivability. 
                        <br><br>
                        A PCC of 5 drastically improves her combat potential, and although her low base stats aren't of much help, Linoan can still be useful
                        as a staff user if you decide to take her on that route. However, she is handicapped with a story-based promotion, which occurs in 
                        Chapter 21, unfortunately. Her usefulness is limited until then. 
                        <br><br>
                        Armed with all of his and a Sage promotion, Linoan is a reliable mage/staff unit that might need some babysitting, depending on if you
                        are going to use her mainly for combat or for staff usage. Perhaps both!

                <p>
                    Linoan's base stats don't really do her any favors. They're quite low, and her base STR/SPD aren't high enough for her to 
                    be a formidable combat unit. Her growths in MAG/SKL/SPD/LCK are pretty good, though. A 0 base DEF stat means you'll obviously
                    want to treat her with care, and a low base HP means she gets fatigued super easily. Regardless, her growths are good enough
                    to justify using her, even if she might not be a combat god right at the very beginning. Her other stats justify using her 
                    as well, just bear with me for a second.

                <p>
                    Linoan's uniqueness lies in her weapon ranks. Most of her weapons ranks are poor except for Light and Staffs. Since her Staff rank 
                    begins at C, she immediately becomes useful since a lot of useful staffs can be used at this weapon rank, including Torch, Ensorcel, 
                    Physic, and Restore. A B Light rank means she will most likely be the only unit in your team that can use the Nosferatu tome, which
                    is a powerful survivability tome. Her PCC is great as well, although she isn't great for combat until after promotion. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Speaking of promotions, the Sage promotion greatly increases her combat stats, but they won't make her absurdly broken right off the 
                    bat, due to Linoan's bases and maybe some RNG screwing. I heavily suggest that you level Linoan as much as you can before Chapter 21, 
                    her story-based promotion, so that she can make the most out of her stats. Also, if Linoan reaches B Staves before her promotion,
                    her promotion will automatically bring her to A Staves. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Chapter 14x is a great training chapter for her, due to the weak pegasus knights and dark mages hitting on MAG. Other than that, 
                    try out her combat and see how she does, and be sure to grant her EXP by abusing her staff utility.

                <h3>Character Tips</h3>

                <p>
                    Linoan's low base HP should fixed up quickly if you decide to use her long term. The Ho√∞r scroll is especially helpful
                    for this! Other scrolls such as the Heim, Dain, Ced, Baldr, Fjalar, and Ullr scrolls are also helpful, as Linoan has 
                    terribly weak stats such as STR and DEF, and stats that could sometimes need a boost, such as MAG/SKL/SPD despite having 
                    good enough growths. However, Linoan doesn't really need any of these scrolls to be useful. Chances are, you won't really 
                    need her as a magic combat unit, so it's usually better to leave these scrolls with the combat units that need a boost. 
                    Linoan can do just fine with her staff utility. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The best scroll you should give her when she is recruited, however, is the Odo scroll. You'll want Linoan to hit 10 SKL 
                    as soon as possible so that you don't risk missing a staff usage at a vital time. Other than that, there really aren't any
                    other tips I could give you other than, simply use her for what she is, a staff bot with some "OK" combat utility.  
                </p>
