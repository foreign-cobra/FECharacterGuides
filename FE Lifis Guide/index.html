                        Lifis is the first thief that can potentially join your roster at the beginning of Chapter 3 if you spared him in Chapter 2x. Thieves in Thracia 776
                        are extremely useful, and Lifis is an important addition to your roster simply because of his base class. 
                        <br><br>
                        Equipped with the Steal skill, Lifis can disarm mages and pick up important items without having to capture a single enemy. He is especially
                        useful in the "Manster Escape Sequence", which feature lots of chests and doors that Lifis can pick. 
                        <br><br>
                        His utility only extends as far as his thieving skills, however. Lifis' combat potential is garbage given his super low PCC and 
                        awful base stats. 
                        <br><br>
                        However, being a thief, Lifis can make the later chapters significantly easier by stealing important items and even weapons if you manage 
                        to build his CON high enough. Just don't expect him to be a combat god, as his growth rates aren't good enough to overshadow his blatantly
                        awful base stats.

                <p>
                    Lifis' base stats aren't any good. As a combat unit, he falls flat and struggles even against axe users. The most troubling stat
                    is his pitiful base 1 LCK. Because of this, he is susceptible to many critical hits, and even if he is equipped with a scroll to block 
                    those critical hits, his hit and avoid is affected by this terrible stat. With low DEF and MAG, Lifis can barely take 2-3 hits in the early
                    game before he goes down. His 7 MOV is nice, as you will want him to run around prison maps quickly when you get to those chapters. His 10
                    SPD is also commendable, but it is below the threshold of a lot of enemy bosses in the early game, and you will want their important items. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    His growth rates are pretty terrible as well, especially in DEF and LCK. Lifis will reliably level SPD in most cases, and he may even gain a few 
                    points in STR if you're lucky. However, his growth rates aren't good enough to drastically improve his combat utility.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The 10% CON growth rate should be the most important aspect of this chart, though. Lifis needs to build CON to excel as a thief.
                    A flat 10% isn't terrible, but it will take a lot of luck to significatly level Lifis' CON so that he can steal heavy weapons such as 
                    master weapons and siege tombs in the mid-late game.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Rogue promotion is quite valuable. It gives much needed points to most of Lifis' troubling stats, such as 
                    DEF/STR and CON. The extra 3 points to STR may make him a reliable fighter against weak enemies, if given a powerful sword. The extra
                    SPD points helps Lifis meet the SPD benchmark for stealing powerful weapons, his DEF points increase his durability, and the extra CON point 
                    is so valuable to Lifis as a theif. The Vantage skill that he gains isn't super useful, and can even be countered heavily by the Wrath 
                    enemies in the late game, but overall, this is a much needed promotion for Lifis. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    With a pathetic PCC of 0, Lifis will struggle with killing the enemies in the late game even if he has capped numerous stats. Leveling up 
                    his sword rank might be a huge difficulty if your Lifis is a liability in combat. Although his promotion gives him a free sword rank,
                    it might not be too useful if you decided to keep Lifis away from combat. However, he can deal some damage against enemies with low DEF,
                    such as dark mages, with a powerful sword, such as a Killing Edge, or even a Master Sword if you level his sword rank enough. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Two movement stars is quite impressive, however. Lifis will proc a second movement opportunity more often than you might initially think.
                    Despite that, Lifis' most valuable stat is his "Steal" skill. This is what allows him to disarm many enemies and nets you valuable weapons
                    without having to spend a penny. Since gold is extremely scarce in Thracia 776, this is a huge plus.

                <h3>Character Tips</h3>

                <p>
                    As a thief, Lifis' usefulness lies solely in his thieving capabilities. Because of this, you should attempt to build Lifis' CON as high 
                    as possible if you intend to use him long-term. The Nal scroll, which is obtained in Chapter 8x in a chest south of the map, is 
                    super useful for this. It provides an extra 10% increase in the CON growth rate. With this equipped, Lifis has a 20% to gain a CON point 
                    every time he levels up. It is up to purely RNG, but building up Lifis' CON as much as possible lets you disarm even the most powerful enemies,
                    as long as their weapons don't have 20 Weight. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you really want to max out Lifis' usefulness, you can stop Lifis' from leveling up until he gets the Nal scroll, but Thracia 776 can easily
                    be beaten without a 20 CON thief, so don't worry too much about this strategy. Capturing is always an option. However, having a high CON thief
                    will make many bosses easier, and it relieves the stress of never having enough gold. Lifis can be your #1 source of tombs and siege weapons 
                    as long as you keep his SPD up and carefully manage his CON. 
                </p>
