                <div id="container">
                    <p>
                        Shiva is a swordfighter that you first encounter in Chapter 2x, but can later be recruited in Chapter 7. He has a tricky recruitment, 
                        but if you manage to work around that, Shiva can be a reliable swordfighter that has a decent amount of survivability. 
                        <br><br>
                        Equipped with good growth rates and a high PCC, Shiva is a standout among many of Thracia's units. He requires a bit of investment due to his
                        low level and stats, but he joins early enough to not become a burden when training him. 
                        <br><br>
                        His high sword rank also makes him appealing. With a B sword rank when starting out, Shiva can immediately be useful. He's also equipped
                        with the Sol skill, which makes him a bit more durable. 
                        <br><br>
                        Although Shiva is not as absurdly broken as another obvious sword user in this game, he has the appropriate combat potential to excel as a fighter
                        and should definitely be considered when building your roster.

                <p>
                    Shiva's base stats are pretty commendable. He has enough strength to do considerable damage against every enemy that isn't an armor, and 
                    his speed allows him to consistently double many other weak enemies. He's excellent at securing kills and perhaps softening up some enemies
                    for you to feed them to your weaker characters. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    His growth rates are also great besides SPD and DEF. His HP and STR growth rates are good enough for a swordfighter, and his a flat 50% growth rate
                    for his SKL is good considering that Sol activates on a skill-percentage chance. His SPD growth rate is a bit low, however, strange for a 
                    swordfigher/myrmidon. His DEF is also quite low, as expected, so he'll still remain a bit of a squishy unit compared to your cavaliers and other 
                    infantry.  
                </p>

                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <p>
                    Swordmaster promotion gains are impressive, especially in Shiva's case. The extra 3 points in SPD is something Shiva will 
                    need if he got unlucky with his SPD growths. The extra DEF is also welcome, and the extra sword ranks are unnecessary, as Shiva
                    can work his way up to an A sword rank passively. He does gain the Adept skill as well, which is helpful, because each extra
                    attack is an extra chance for him to proc Sol, possibly saving him in some tough situations. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Shiva's most impressive "other" stat is his high PCC. With a PCC of 4, Shiva can decimate many enemies quite easily if given
                    a Killing Edge or any other weapon with a decent crit chance. He can also do a lot of work in the endgame if given a Master Sword,
                    since the Brave Effect of that sword almost guarantees a critical if the enemies' luck is atrocious. Shiva is a combat master due 
                    to his commendable growth rates, and his promotion gains fix the issues he may have when leveling up, so it'll be difficult for 
                    Shiva to <i>not</i> be usable unless he got really, and I mean <i>really</i> unlucky SPD/DEF level-ups. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As for other utility, Shiva doesn't have much to offer. He has no leadership stars to benefit your entire roster, but he does have 
                    one movement star that procs semi-regularly if you use him continously. 5% is 5%! 
                </p>

                <h3>Character Tips</h3>

                <p>
                    Shiva's utility may not be apparent the second you recruit him, and his performance might be a little unimpressive if you have 
                    already decided to promote of your units. However, his high sword rank and unique Sol skill are enough reasons to give him a try.
                    The two chapters after you recruit Shiva, Chapters 8 and 8x, are loaded with low hit rate axe users that are perfect for training 
                    Shiva. Be sure to give him the Ced scroll during these chapters, as he really needs the SPD growth rate bonus to continously
                    double as you progress through the harder and harder chapters. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Shiva isn't only useful against axe users. He hits hard and fast, and his high sword rank allows him
                    to use effective weapons pretty early on, making him a formidable opponent to any enemy.After he gains some levels, and 
                    especially after he promotes, he might not require any more scrolls to boost his stats other than the DEF scroll, Dain.  Don't be trigger happy with him, though,
                    as his Sol skill is quite unreliable. Don't depend on it and use that as an excuse to throw Shiva into a handful of enemies. Thracia
                    won't let you off the hook that easy!
                </p>
