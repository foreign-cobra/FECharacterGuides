                    <p>
                        Finn is the beloved Lance Knight that serves Leif throughout the entire game. He joins as soon as Chapter 1 starts and is 
                        significantly stronger than most of your starter units. 
                        <br><br>
                        Being Level 7 and already having access to a personal weapon, with a Brave Effect no less, Finn acts a secondary Jagen 
                        that can easily take care of most enemies in the early-game with little to no effort, as long as he has his Brave Lance 
                        in hand. 
                        <br><br>
                        Despite having shaky growth rates and a PCC of 1, Finn's Miracle skill, personal weapon, and early-game usefulness makes him 
                        a great unit to use. By the time Finn requires some good level-ups, you will have access to the appropriate Crusader Scrolls 
                        that will keep him viable throughout the entire game. 
                        <br><br>
                        Being a mounted unit, Finn must dismount to be used in some indoor maps, and some outdoor/indoor hybrid maps. He cannot use 
                        lances while dismounted, so keep this in mind as you play the game and decide who to deploy.

                <p>
                    Finn's base stats are great. He has some of the highest DEF compared to most of your starter units, has a high MOV, and an even higher 
                    CON for being mounted. One of Finn's greatest traits is that he can easily capture early-game units with his high CON, MOV, and great 
                    SPD, which has a base of 11. He also boasts a commendable 8 STR and SKL, making him a reliable combat unit in the beginning. Even without 
                    his personal weapon, Finn is one of the best candidates for capturing, simply because he is a mounted unit and can easily transfer 
                    captures units with other player units with high CON.        
                </p>

                <p>
                    This Lance Knight's growth rates are a bit shaky, though. He has a 30-35% growth rate in STR, SKL, SPD, and DEF, which are all vital 
                    combat stats. It's easy for Finn to have quite a few bad level-ups. The good news is that since Finn is already level 7, he will receive 
                    significantly low EXP from killing/capturing enemies, meaning that he won't level up all that much in the early-game, giving you plenty 
                    of levels to work with once you receive the vital Crusader Scrolls, such as the Ho√∞r, Baldr, Ced, and Odo scrolls. Once you do receive these 
                    scrolls, you can work around Finn's mediocre growth rates with them. Also, I should mention that Finn has a great 45% growth rate in LCK, and 
                    this is important, as Finn's personal skill, Miracle, activates based on the LCK stat. More on that later.

                <p>
                    A B rank in Lances, and a +1 in Lance Rank as a promotion bonus means Finn can wield every lance in the game besides one other PRF lance. 
                    A D rank in Swords is a bit of a let-down, as Finn won't be using swords most of the time since he's super useful as an 
                    outdoor combat unit. However, leveling Finn's sword rank isn't difficult, as he has quite a bit of bulk, strength, and 
                    speed to fight decently with an Iron Sword, at least in the early-game. Finn's other promotion bonuses are great, as he 
                    receives nice bonuses to STR, SKL, and SPD/DEF. He even gains an additional CON/MOV! It ain't much, but these bonuses 
                    simply boosts Finn's usefulness by a decent margin. 
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Having a PCC of 1, Finn might struggle to kill enemy units as you progress through the game, but his personal weapon 
                    and his SPD makes it easier to one-round enemies. No movement star is disappointing, but Finn's amazing MOV is enough 
                    to justify why an additional movement star might be broken. Finn also has a leadership star, so if nothing else, 
                    you may deploy him simply to boost your army's hit/avoid. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finally, we must discuss Finn's Miracle skill. It has a User's LCK x 3 activation rate, and if it does activate, then the 
                    unit's avoid is increased by 100%, making them pretty much immune to any attack as long as Miracle activiates. This
                    is the best survivability tool in the game, and makes Finn an excellent tank as long as his LCK is high. 
                    If you manage to cap Finn's LCK to 20, then Finn will have a 60% chance to just dodge any fatal attack, no matter what. 
                    Even in the early-game, Finn's PRF grants a LCK bonus, so he'll have a good chance to null a fatal attack even in the 
                    early game. Definitely use this to your advantage if you have nothing else. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Brave Lance is one of the best PRF's in the game due to its availability. Finn has it in his starting kit, and it 
                    has great capturing ability because of its Brave Effect. Given the fact that Finn has a decently high SPD already, 
                    he can possibly quadruple attack enemies even while he's capturing. Overall, this PRF is great for capturing.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Granting a LCK bonus of 10, Finn's Miracle skill has a much higher chance to activate, even in the early-game. By 
                    having this bonus, this PRF indirectly boosts Finn's survivability as well. Definitely use this weapon to your 
                    advantage. It's made available to you so early on for a reason!

                <h3>Character Tips</h3>

                <p>
                    Finn naturally has a high avoid due to his good LCK growth and the bonus from his Brave Lance. However, his avoid 
                    can be increased even further by having Nanna close to him during combat. Nanna supports Finn, granting an additional 
                    10% to hit/avoid/etc., and she has the Charisma skill, which boosts his avoid even further. A Finn with capped LCK 
                    holding his Brave Lance with Nanna less than 3 tiles away is pretty much invincible because of Avoid bonuses 
                    and Miracle. Just a tip! 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As I mentioned earlier, don't fret about Finn's growth rates. By the time your characters reach Finn's base level, and 
                    by the time Finn is receiving the standard amount of EXP for killing enemy units, you will have access to good 
                    Crusader Scrolls. I don't have a list of ones you should use, as Finn benefits from all of them. All I will say is that 
                    the Heim scroll is a bit useless since Finn has no need for MAG growth rate bonuses, and the Bragi scroll is an excellent 
                    choice for increasing Finn's LCK and making the most of his Miracle skill. 
                </p>
