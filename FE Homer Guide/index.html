                <div id="container">
                    <p>
                        Homer is a bard that is recruited in Chapter 14 by Nanna if she visits the eastern red house in the city of Tahra. Homer is 
                        one of those characters that requires good investment in order to be a good unit. 
                        <br><br>
                        This unit may not seem too useful because of his okay-ish base stats and his pitifully low weapon ranks, especially given the 
                        fact that he joins only halfway into the game. However, Homer is a great unit if you take the time to train him, and for good reason.
                        <br><br>
                        Equipped with the Paragon skill and 5 PCC, Homer can be a force to be reckoned with if you manage to get his SPD past the threshold
                        so he can double. Once he does so, Homer is extremely fatal to many enemies with his absurd 5 PCC and Sage promotion, which is 
                        always great.  
                        <br><br>
                        Homer might seem like a terrible mage to use at the start, but with Paragon, he can easily gains levels and start to be useful.
                        Then, after promotion, Homer becomes one of your best magic users.

                <p>
                    As I mentioned in the overview, Homer's base stats don't really amount to much in the start. He has a terrible 0 STR, and that 
                    heavily weighs him down, so much so, that not even his decent 10 SPD allows him to double most enemies. His 0% STR growth is 
                    also very troubling... but everything else about Homer is pretty great. His SKL/SPD/LCK grows like a weed if you feed him some 
                    kills in Chapter 14 and 14x, and his MAG growth might be a little concerning at 40%, but with a Sage promotion, all of Homer's 
                    stats become easily fixed. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I know it may seem strange to base a unit's viability based on its promotion alone, but in Homer's case, his Paragon skill and 
                    his Sage promotion pretty much invalidates his base stats and excuses some of his more "shaky" growths. It may be a little troublesome
                    to train Homer, but it is most definitely worth it, as his stats starting growing out of control once he reaches a few levels. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    You've probably learned from Asbel that Sage promotions are the best in the entire game. With a +6 to MAG/SKL and a +4 to 
                    SPD/DEF, as well as a +1 to most magic, a +2 to Light, and the ability to use staves, this single promotion transforms Homer from a 
                    C tier character to high A tier. Homer immediately becomes useful once you promote him, and he'll be able to start doubling 
                    and critting like nobody's business. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Critting will be very likely, as Homer boasts a massive 5 PCC. Also, with the much needed weapon rank bonuses that Homer gains through
                    promotion, Homer will be able to use many more tomes. He's also one of the few mages that can reliably use Light magic, although 
                    I recommend not using his Lightning tome until he promotes, since he'll be able to use the Nosferatu tome due to the +2 Light weapon 
                    ranks he gains through promotion. In any case, due whatever it takes to train Homer if you decide to use him. Getting him to promotion
                    is a massive priority. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Homer also has some tools to act again, although they are pretty unlikely. He has a movement star, so there's a 5% chance to act again, 
                    and he gains the Adept skill after promoting, so he'll be able to perform very well in combat. 
                </p>

                <h3>Character Tips</h3>

                <p>
                    Homer can heavily benefit from a few scrolls that Thracia offers throughout the game. First off, getting Homer's MAG/SPD 
                    capped is a priority, and while that may be pretty easy to do with his broken Sage promotion, Homer's 40% growth makes 
                    it somewhat easy to get MAG screwed in a few levels. As a result, the Heim scroll is the perfect solution. It offers a 
                    hefty +30% growth in MAG, but a -10% in DEF, basically killing Homer's DEF growth. This isn't too much of an issue since
                    Homer won't be gaining any significant amount of DEF in his role as a physically fragile Sage, but keep this weakness 
                    in mind. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    If Homer's terrible 0 STR and 0% STR growth bothers you because his tomes keep weighing him down, then using the Njörun
                    scroll can fix this issue with its +30% STR growth, although you might not get anything out of it, since 30% is still 
                    pretty low, but it can relieve some of Homer's STR weakness if you're lucky. The last scroll that Homer can abuse is the 
                    Dain scroll which offers a +30% growth in DEF. It brings his DEF growth to 45%, so a decent chance to level up DEF a 
                    few times, but if another character deserves more DEF, then you can skip this tip on Homer. Homer is a good unit even without
                    scroll abuse, but these three scrolls can noticeably patch up his weaknesses. 
                </p>
