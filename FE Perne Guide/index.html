                    <p>
                        Perne, or "Pahn", is a Rogue who can be recruited in Chapter 12x by having either Lifis, Lara, or Salem. It is recommended that you have Lara
                        speak to him for the Dancer promotion. Anyway, Perne is an amazing addition to your team due to his great combat ability and thief utility. 
                        He can be a reliable fighter in your army while picking locks and stealing powerful weapons. 
                        <br><br>
                        Equipped with powerful stats such as a PCC of 5, 5 movement stars, and a decent CON, Perne can easily move around the map with little effort 
                        and make himself useful by picking any lock and stealing valuable weapons. His great PCC allows him to fight extremely well, especially so 
                        with weapons with about 10-20 crit. 
                        <br><br>
                        Perne also has the Vantage and Sol skills, further aiding his durability. With a Sword Rank of B, he can already wield a wide range of swords 
                        such as Rapiers and Armorslayers that deal effective damage, making him an amazing fighter. 
                        <br><br>
                        At the end of the day, Perne remains an improvement/replacement compared to Lifis, as these are the only thieves you can recruit in the game besides 
                        Lara. Perne's amazing growths, skills, hidden stats, and thieving skills make him one of the most valuable units you could ever ask for.

                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <p>
                    Perne's base stats may be a bit below average for a pre-promote, but they can easily be remedied with a few level-ups, since Perne has great growth
                    rates in HP and STR, as well as SKL/SPD/LCK. He won't be a combat god right off the bat, but he has high enough avoid to perform well against 
                    axe enemies, and his 7 STR is also quite nice. Also his base stats are only a margin higher than Lifis', his growth rates tell another story. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    A 40% growth in STR and a 65% growth in SPD is <i>really</i> good. This will ensure that Perne can achieve the STR/SPD thresholds to kill enemy 
                    units with double attacks. Although his DEF growth and DEF base stat is pretty mediocre, considering he's already promoted, Perne's utility 
                    isn't limited to just his combat. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Like Lifis, Perne has a 10% CON growth rate. If you intend on using Perne long term, or plan to replace Lifis, entirely, a great tip is to increase 
                    Perne's CON as much as you can. More on that later.

                <p>
                    Perne's other stats are amazing. He has a commendable B Sword Rank, 5 PCC, 5 movement stars, and 3 skills, all of which are useful. That's insane!
                    First things first, let's discuss Perne's skills. His Steal skill should speak for itself. This skill is as useful as however high Perne's 
                    CON rank is. As for Sol and Ambush, this greatly opens Perne's combat options. Given a Brave weapon, Perne could potentially one-round enemies 
                    before they get a chance to touch him. Sol is also RNG-dependent, and not super reliable, but Perne's SKL growth is great, so it will trigger 
                    somewhat often if you cap his SKL stat.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    As mentioned earlier, Perne can wield a wide range of swords due to his high base sword rank. Effective weapons are useful to him, and if you 
                    manage to rank up his sword level to A, Perne can wield the Brave Sword quite well due to his Vantage skill. A PCC of 5 guarantees that every 
                    consecutive attack is a critical if Perne wields a sword with at least 20 crit, so Killing Edges are also very useful to Perne.  A great PCC also 
                    ensures that Perne's STR stat won't matter <i>too</i> much, in case you get screwed in that stat. 5 movement stars mean a 25% chance to move again, 
                    which is yet another asset to Perne. 
                </p>
                    Although it is unfortunate that Perne lacks promotion bonuses, and that his stats a little low for a prepromote, his growths and other stats 
                    greatly make up for it.

                <h3>Character Tips</h3>

                <p>
                    The tips for maximizing Perne's potential are mostly the same as for Lifis. The Nál will be of great use to you, as it 
                    will increase Perne's CON growth stat to 20%, a decent chance to level up a few points of CON, but you'll have to be 
                    lucky. Honestly, Lifis is better for maximizing CON, as he has far more room to level up than Perne, but Perne can 
                    still benefit from the Nál scroll. 
                </p>
                    Perne's STR and DEF growths are pretty decent, but if you find yourself getting RNG-screwed, and wish to see Perne 
                    engage in more combat, consider giving him the Hoðr, Baldr, and/or the Dain scrolls. These are purely for combat growth. 
                    Other than maximizing stats, make sure to take care of Perne. He's not invincible, he's still a thief, so utilize his 
                    ability to lockpick chests, doors, and most importantly, steal items from enemies. 
                <p>
