                    <p>
                        Dalsin is an Axe Armor unit that can be recruited in Chapter 4 by talking to him with Leif or Lifis if and only if you saved Yubel in the 
                        previous chapter. It's a pretty complicated recruitment by Fire Emblem's standards, and one that isn't too worth it. 
                        <br><br>
                        Being an Armor unit, Dalsin is burdened with poor SPD, accuracy, and poor MAG defense. While he does have a high HP and a considerable 
                        amount of DEF and CON, he struggles combat-wise and lacks a lot of other utility. 
                        <br><br>
                        Many mid-late game enemies are equipped with powerful magic and armor-slaying weapons, so Dalsin will especially struggle if you continue 
                        to use him throughout the story's campaign. He's still usable, though, as Crusader scrolls can give him the edge in terms of HP and DEF, making 
                        him a useful tank. He's great for soaking up hits in the first few chapters you recruit him in as well. 
                        <br><br>
                        Many players drop Dalsin because of his lack of combat potential and because of his common Armor Knight weaknesses, but with a little patience 
                        and grinding (and a lot of scroll abuse) Dalsin might just come out on top.

                <p>
                    Dalsin boasts a considerably high 29 base HP, a base 11 DEF and an absurd base 15 CON. This makes Dalsin a good candidate for capturing 
                    at a glance, but if you notice Dalsin's poor base 3 SKL and base 2 SPD, you'll realize that he'll struggle to hit anything in the first
                    place. Attacking with Dalsin will always be a gamble, as he will not double in most cases because of his poor SPD, and his accuracy is 
                    <i>very</i> shaky. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the other hand, Dalsin's great DEF is good for tanking. However, if a unit's DEF is too high, so much so that the enemy won't deal any 
                    damage, then they won't attack at all. This can backfire if you want to use Dalsin to bait enemy units, but be wary of armor-slaying weapons 
                    and magic. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dalsin's growth rates are pretty bad. He has a commendable 40% growth in SKL, and good growths in HP/STR, as expected, but everything else is 
                    a bit too low. Even DEF and CON, Dalsin's best base stats, only have about a 20-25% growth rate. If you want to grind Dalsin, I heavily suggest 
                    using Crusader scrolls.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    With no leadership/movement stars, no skills, and a PCC of 1, Dalsin doesn't have much else to show for himself. He does have a B rank in Axes, which is great 
                    as you don't have to go through the trouble of training it. Reaching A rank should be easy if you're using Dalsin consistently. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dalsin's promotion gains are actually pretty impressive. He gains points towards STR and SPD, and a significant bonus to 
                    SKL, which will drastically improve his accuracy. He gains a single point in CON/MOV and 4 points in DEF. Overall, these are great 
                    bonuses with the exception of the pitiful 2 points to SPD. He also gains access to every other physical weapon in the game, but the weapon
                    rank gains are bit useless since it's difficult to train these weapon ranks from the ground up. 
                </p>

                <h3>Character Tips</h3>

                <p>
                    The most beneficial scrolls you could stick on Dalsin are the Ced scroll (for his SPD growth), the Od scroll (for his SKL growth), and the 
                    Dain scroll (for his DEF growth). Other scrolls are also useful as well since they offer growth gains across many categories. 
                    I recommend the Nj√∂run scroll if Dalsin's STR isn't going anywhere.   
                </p>

                <p>
                    The most difficult part of training Dalsin is getting him to promotion. To make this easier, I highly recommend bringing the Brave Axe with you 
                    during the Manster Escape sequence, the chapters that occur after Chapter 3. You can do this by putting the Brave Axe in either Leif or Lifis' 
                    inventory before seizing the Chapter 3 throne. Once you recover the Brave Axe in Chapter 4, talk to Dalsin and give him the Axe. Since Dalsin
                    struggles with accuracy and SPD, the Brave effect of the Axe will help him out greatly. Also, if you think it's worth it, you could try giving Dalsin
                    the Wrath manual. With Wrath and the Brave Axe, Dalsin's enemy phase potential gets much better, as his first counterattack will deal significant damage
                    if it hits, and he'll always attack twice if he has the Brave Axe equipped. Try doing this if you want to take Dalsin to endgame. 
                </p>
